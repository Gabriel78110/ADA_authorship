Library to facilitate HC-based test to discriminate word frequency tables
and attribute authorship. 

The project contains two main files:
'AuthAttrib.py' -- 2 models for authorship attribution: 
                  'AuthorshipAttributionMulti' -- comparision of disputed text to each author
                  'AuthorshipAttributionMultiBinary' -- head to head comparison of each author against another
                  
'HC_aux.py' -- auxiliary functions to evaluate Higher Criticism tests 

The interface requires arranging the data in a pandas dataframe with columns 
<author>|<doc_id>|<text> 
all of which are strings. 

See 'AuthorshipAttribution_example.ipynb' for an example use case in
authorship attribution challenges.
